## Overview
DemandProphet is an algorithmic economics tool designed to optimize supply chain inventory. By leveraging a Random Forest Regressor, the system predicts exactly how many units of a product a retail location should stock based on upcoming weather patterns, public holidays, and marketing promotions.


## 🧠 Why it matters
Overstocking leads to waste (and higher carbon footprints), while understocking leads to lost revenue. This predictive engine finds the mathematical sweet spot.
